# 🏆 Face-Detector  
**A face detection system built using OpenCV and deep learning.**

## 📌 Overview  
Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, widely used in security, biometric authentication, and even fun applications like filters and augmented reality.  
This project provides a **real-time, high-accuracy face detection system** that can identify and locate faces in images and video streams.

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Real-time Face Detection** – Process images and video streams seamlessly.  
✅ **Multiple Faces Support** – Detect multiple faces in a single frame.  
✅ **High Accuracy** – Uses deep learning techniques for precise face localization.  
✅ **Scalability** – Works efficiently on both CPU and GPU-powered machines.  
✅ **Easy Integration** – Modular design to plug into other applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
Open a terminal and run:  
```
git clone https://github.com/Shoshinmai/Face-Detector.git
cd Face-Detector
```
### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
If a requirements.txt file is available, install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** Don't forget to install torch with cuda(compatable)
## 🎯 Usage
📹 Detect your Face in a Video Stream

## 📚 How It Works
1. Preprocessing → Loads the image/video and converts it to a suitable format.
2. Face Detection → Uses OpenCV and deep learning-based methods to detect faces.
3. Bounding Boxes → Draws rectangles around detected faces.
4. Output Generation → Displays or saves the processed image with detected faces.

## 🛠️ Customization
🔹  Change Detection Algorithm → Modify face_detector.py to use different models (e.g., Haar cascades, HOG, CNN).

🔹  Improve Performance → Run on a GPU by installing tensorflow-gpu (if using deep learning models).

🔹 Add Face Recognition → Extend the project by incorporating face_recognition library for identifying faces.
